<p><span style='font-weight:bold; color:#1A5276;'>The use of drone imagery to quantify impacts of 2018 debris flow on the Carpinteria Salt Marsh.</span><br/><span style='font-style:normal;'>Andrew J. Brooks and Thomas Bell</span></p><p style='margin-left:1em; font-style:italic;'>In January of 2018 following the Thomas Fire, a massive debris flow occurred in the foothills of the Santa Ynez mountains north of the City of Carpinteria.  In a similar fashion to the well publicized Montecito debris flow, the Carpinteria debris flow washed tremendous amounts of large woody debris, rocks and sediment into local creeks and then into the Carpinteria Salt Marsh, a 230 acre coastal wetland just west of the City of Carpinteria. We used drone imagery captured in November 2017 before the debris flow and in January 2018 immediately following the debris flow and in January 2019 to estimate the impacts of the event and subsequent recovery on the bathymetry of the marsh channels.</p><hr/>

Methane footprint is poorly quantified so far in fields like dairy farms, oil rigs, gas industry etc. This talk will focus on methane emission drone swarm sensing to better understand permafrost thawing dynamics that is linked to global warming and extreme weathers.</p><hr/>

Cattau Carol Wessman, Jennifer Balch, Maxwell Joseph, Joseph McGlinchy, Brian Johnson</span></p><p style='margin-left:1em; font-style:italic;'>Over the past 30 years, forests of the western United States have experienced a variety of natural disturbances, including drought, insect outbreaks, wildfires, blowdown events, and human land use. Datasets on canopy composition and structure are combined with disturbance history, including field-based forest inventories, drone-mounted sensor data, and moderate resolution satellite data, to investigate if disturbance interactions produce vegetation state transitions and threshold behaviors.</p><hr/>
