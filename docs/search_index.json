Welcome and Overview DroneCamp is a collaborative training program from multiple campuses within the University California and California State University systems. Now in its 4th year, DroneCamp 2020 has gone virtual in response to the Coronavirus pandemic. This session will introduce the organizations and people behind DroneCamp, and provide an overview of the course sessions and technology. Format: presentation / demo Instructor(s): Maggi Kelly Materials: Slides 9:10 - 9:50. Drone Mapping Workflow and Applications Using drones for mapping and data collection is complicated! This session will summarize the entire workflow, including defining the goals, selecting equipment, site planning, determining regulatory requirements, mission planning, actually flying (the fun part!), processing images with photogrammetry software, analyzing data, and sharing results with collaborators. Along the way, we’ll highlight which DroneCamp sessions to attend for more details, and provide examples from actual projects. Format: presentation / demo Instructor(s): Sean Hogan, Andy Lyons Materials: Slides 11:00 - 11:50. Drone Safety and Regulations Overview Although still a novel technology, there’s been a lot of progress in the development of best practices for flying drones safely, as well as how to comply with regulations. This session will review the background of drone safety practices and describe the landscape of regulations from the local to the national, highlighting what you need to know to stay out of trouble. Recent and upcoming changes to FAA rules will also be described. Although this is not a Part-107 study session, a list of resources for getting your remote pilot license will be shared. Format: presentation / demo Instructor(s): Brandon Stark, Jonathan Rivas 14:00 - 14:50. Mission Planning Collecting good data starts with good flight or mission planning. Mission planning must incorporate a number of factors, including the capabilities of your equipment (i.e., flight time), safety margins, planning for contingencies, weather, terrain, your project goals, the type of sensor, and your flight management software. This session will review the principles of mission planning, and strategies for dealing with challenging environments. From there we’ll go into breakout rooms for demos of popular flight management apps including Pix4Dcapture, Drone Deploy, DJI Pilot, and eMotion. Format: presentation / demo Instructor(s): Andy Lyons Additional instructions: For the hands-on portion of the workshop, we’ll go into Zoom breakout rooms for a demos of different mission planning apps. Materials: Slides Exercise 15:00 - 15:50. How to be a Good Visual Observer After the Pilot in Command, the most important person on the flight crew is probably the Visual Observer(s). In this workshop, you will learn the key roles of a Visual Observer, how Visual Observers fit in under Part 107, the essential elements of a pre-flight briefing, skills for monitoring air traffic, and strategies for effective crew communication. Format: presentation / demo Instructor(s): Brandon Stark, Jonathan Rivas Materials: Slides 15:00 - 15:50. High Precision Mapping Although drone data can be incredibly detailed, high resolution does not mean high precision! High precision means the recorded location of your images and processed drone products is accurate to within a few inches or less relative to established geodesic control points. Drones are capable of capturing very precise data, but to do so you need special equipment and data processing steps. This workshop will cover everything you need to know to create highly precise maps from drones, including legal definitions and standards you need to be aware of in certain applications.
