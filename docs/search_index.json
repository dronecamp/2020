This session will introduce the organizations and people behind DroneCamp, and provide an overview of the course sessions and technology. Format: presentation / demo Materials: Slides 9:10 - 9:50. Drone Mapping Workflow Overview A drone mapping project begins with identifying your goals and concludes with sharing your results and data. This introductory session will review the overall data processing pipeline, and highlight where subsequent DroneCamp workshops fall within the workflow. Format: presentation / demo Instructor(s): Andy Lyons, Sean Hogan Materials: Slides 10:00 - 10:50. Hardware Options: Drones and Sensors Hardware selection requires balance your objectives, available options, and budget.

A little background noise is not a problem as you can mute yourself, but consider a pair of headphones to minimize distractions. Ergonomics are important! If you’ve ever tried to work on a laptop while sitting on a couch for 4 hours, it isn’t ideal. If you plan on multitasking, considering joining the audio via phone and headset so you have the option to move around. Zoom This workshop will be taught entirely online using Zoom. The link(s) will be sent you a week or two before DroneCamp starts. Please install the Zoom Client for Meetings on your computer. If you’ve used Zoom before, and you see Zoom in the Start Menu (Windows) or Finder (Mac), then you already have the client.

Viewing Zoom and GIS / Photogrammetry Software Simultaneously Dual Screens A second screen is very helpful, especially for hands-on workshops where you’ll be working through a software exercise. With a second screen, you can view the instructor / slides in one window, and work on RStudio in the other. If you have an external monitor for your laptop / computer, you’re all set. You can put Zoom on one monitor and RStudio on the other. If you don’t have a second monitor, a tablet can be used to watch the slides / presentation as you work through the exercise on your laptop. Zoom is available as an app for all major tablets and phones. Single Screen Options If a second screen isn’t possible, you can also arrange your windows so that you see both your GIS program and Zoom side-by-side (see below for example). You can devote the entire width of the Zoom window to the screen share by going to ‘View Options’ and making sure side-by-side mode is turned off. arranging GIS and Zoom side-by-side on a single screen Tip: Zoom unfortunately does not have an ‘always on top’ mode, but you can keep the Zoom client on top by using a 3rd party utility like DeskPins. Zoom Audio If you find the audio is garbled, you can dial-in with a phone. In that case, you should disconnect from the the audio on your laptop or tablet (to prevent echo). Muting and unmuting yourself are essential skills for Zoom. It’s generally good practice to stay muted until you have something to say. If you’re using the Zoom app on Windows, click the microphone button. If you’re using the Zoom app for phones and tablets, tap the middle of the screen to make the controls visible. If you dial-in on a phone, you can use the ‘mute’ button on your phone app, or dial *6 to mute or unmute yourself.
