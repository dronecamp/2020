The use of drone imagery to quantify impacts of 2018 debris flow on the Carpinteria Salt Marsh.Andrew J. Brooks and Thomas Bell In January of 2018 following the Thomas Fire, a massive debris flow occurred in the foothills of the Santa Ynez mountains north of the City of Carpinteria. In a similar fashion to the well publicized Montecito debris flow, the Carpinteria debris flow washed tremendous amounts of large woody debris, rocks and sediment into local creeks and then into the Carpinteria Salt Marsh, a 230 acre coastal wetland just west of the City of Carpinteria. We used drone imagery captured in November 2017 before the debris flow and in January 2018 immediately following the debris flow and in January 2019 to estimate the impacts of the event and subsequent recovery on the bathymetry of the marsh channels. Methane emission drone swarm sensing to better understand permafrost thawing dynamicsDerek Hollenbeck and YangQuan Chen Using drones as moving sensors to sense the chemical plumes is a challenging problem with rich opportunities.

["zoom.html", "Zoom Tips Setting Up Your Workspace Use the Zoom Client Managing Zoom Audio Viewing Zoom and GIS Software Simultaneously", " Zoom Tips Setting Up Your Workspace Try to find a spot which is comfortable and relatively free from distractions and background noise. Some people find a pair of headphones helps minimize distractions. Ergonomics are important also! If you’ve ever tried to work on a laptop while sitting on a couch for 4 hours, it isn’t ideal. If you plan on multitasking, considering joining the audio via phone and headset so you have the option to move around. Use the Zoom Client Although you can join Zoom meetings through a browser, we recommend installing the Zoom Client for Meetings. You may already have it if you’ve used Zoom before, and you see it in the Start Menu (Windows) or Finder (Mac). Please make sure you have the latest version, as some of the buttons and features have changed. Note: As of May 30 2020, Zoom will only allow you to connect to meetings with version 5.0 or higher of the Zoom client. A Zoom account is not required. A webcam is not required. Managing Zoom Audio If you find your Zoom audio is garbled, perhaps due to poor bandwidth, you can dial-in with a phone. Click the microphone button on Zoom for details. In that case, you should disconnect from the the audio on your laptop or tablet (to prevent echo). Muting and unmuting yourself are essential skills for Zoom. It’s generally good practice to stay muted until you have something to say. If you’re using the Zoom app on Windows, click the microphone button. If you’re using the Zoom app for phones and tablets, tap the middle of the screen to make the controls visible. If you dial-in on a phone, you can use the ‘mute’ button on your phone app, or dial *6 to mute or unmute yourself. Viewing Zoom and GIS Software Simultaneously Best Option: Dual Monitors A second screen is very helpful, especially for hands-on workshops where you’ll be working through a software exercise. With a second screen, you can view the instructor’s slides or demo on one screen, and open your GIS program on the other. If you have an external monitor for your laptop / computer, you’re all set. (Tip: turn on Zoom’s dual monitors option, see below). Many TVs can be pulled into service as a second monitor depending on the video ports. If you don’t have a second monitor, a tablet may come in handy. You can only connect to Zoom on one device, but you can view the presentation &amp; exercise instructions on the tablet as you work through the exercise on your laptop. Zoom is available as an app for all major tablets and phones. Connecting an external monitor to your computer is the best option for doing hands-on software workshops in Zoom Tips for Using Zoom on a Single Screen Tip 1. Print out the Exercise Guide Many of the software workshops have some kind of exercise guide, shared as a PDF or a website, that the instructor will work through as you follow along. Printing the exercise guide might seem old-fashioned, but it will be one less window you have to manage during the workshop. Printing in black and white and on scrap paper will save ink and resources. Tip 2. Turn on ‘Dual Monitors’ The Zoom client for Windows has a ‘Dual Monitors’ option that will open up screen shares in a separate window. You don’t actually need two monitors. This option is really useful on a single monitor, because you can move and resize the screen share window anywhere you’d like (and even ‘pin’ it to stay on top, see below). To turn on Dual Monitors, click the gear icon (Settings) in the Zoom client, then check ‘Dual Monitors’. Tip 3. Place Windows Side-by-Side You can arrange your windows so that you see both your GIS program and Zoom side-by-side (see below for example). You can devote the entire width of the Zoom window to the screen share by going to ‘View Options’ and making sure side-by-side mode is turned off. A keyboard shortcut to move windows to the left or right is windows key + left/right arrows. You can then choose which of the remaining windows to put in the other half of the screen. By default, Windows will divide the screen into equal halves, but if you resize the width right after you use the shortcut, it will remember the setting. Arranging GIS and Zoom side-by-side on a single screen Tip 4. Use Sticky Notes If you like to take notes during Zoom meetings, a Sticky Notes utility can help. Almost all sticky notes programs have an option to stay on top, so you don’t have to worry about your notes disappearing. Windows has a built-in ‘Sticky Notes’ app, but an even better one is Stickies from Zhorn Software. Tip 5. Keep Windows on Top with DeskPins Surprisingly Zoom does not have an ‘always on top’ mode, but you can keep the Zoom client on top by using a 3rd party utility like DeskPins (Windows). In conjunction with Zoom’s Dual Monitor options, DeskPins lets you ‘pin’ the screen share window on top, so you can watch the presenter’s demo while also working in your GIS program. Pinned windows can still be resized and moved around so it doesn’t get in the way of what you’re working on. To ‘pin’ a window, right-click on the DeskPins icon in the system tray, and select ‘Enter Pin Mode’. To ‘unpin’ a window, simply click the little ‘x’ button that appears when you hover over the pushpin icon. "],
["setup.html", "Computer Setup GIS and Photogrammetry Software Mission Planning Apps", " Computer Setup GIS and Photogrammetry Software Below are installation instructions for the different GIS and photogrammetry programs that will be used at DroneCamp. Note you probably don’t need to (or want to) install all these programs. Agisoft Metashape and Pix4Dmapper are both professional quality drone photogrammetry programs. They have similar features and both offer trial licenses. You’re welcome to install them both if you want to take both workshops (Tues &amp; Wed) to compare them. If you have to pick just one, Pix4Dmapper is slightly easier to use but also more expensive after the trial period. ArcGIS Pro and QGIS are desktop GIS software. They’re both well-developed and supported. QGIS is open source and therefore free to install and use. ArcGIS Pro requires a subscription which can be expensive unless you have access to it through your organization (many colleges and universities provide it to their students and staff). ArcGIS Pro also has the ability to stitch drone images. WebODM Lightning is a lightweight GUI for Windows (free). When connected to an OpenDroneMap processing engine, you can use it to stitch images into 2D and 3D products. The processing engine that does all the number crunching can be in the cloud, your network, or your computer. QGIS and Agisoft Metashape are available for Mac OS, Linux, and Windows. ArcGIS Pro and Pix4Dmapper are Windows only. Agisoft Metashape Agisoft Metashape is a professional photogrammetry program (see feature list). It requires a relatively new computer with at least 16GB RAM, a multi-core CPU (i7 or equivalent recommended), and preferably a compatible GPU. For additional details see System Requirements. Installing Metashape requires about 500MB of hard drive space. The demo files for the DroneCamp Metashape workshop will be approximately 5GB (see the workshop description for the link). Unfortunately there is no cloud VM option for Metashape If you are unable to install the software on your own computer, you are welcome to join the workshop anyway and follow the instructor(s) as they go through the exercise. Download the latest released version of Agisoft Metashape Professional Edition (currently 1.6.2) from: https://www.agisoft.com/downloads/installer/ Installation is fairly straight-forward. When you first launch Metashape, you’ll be prompted to enter a license code or start a 30-day trial. Caution: don’t start your 30-day Metashape trial until May 27, 2020, or later, otherwise it’ll expire before DroneCamp! If you’d like to familiarize yourself with Metashape before DroneCamp (recommended), there are number of tutorials and sampe datasets available from Agisoft. ArcGIS Pro ArcGIS Pro vs. ArcMap ArcGIS Pro is the latest destkop GIS software from ESRI. It is not the same as the venerable ArcMap (aka ArcGIS Desktop), which is on its way out. If you’ve used ArcMap, it will help you pick up ArcGIS Pro, but they are not the same. All ArcGIS workshops at DroneCamp are using ArcGIS Pro. Note: ArcGIS Pro runs on Windows only. a) Get a License THe first step for installing ArcGIS Pro is getting a license. For a long time ESRI has had a 21-day ArcGIS Trial program, however at the current time this program is limited to organizations responding to the COVID-19 pandemic. ESRI is currently giving out free software licenses to all students, including ArcGIS Pro desktop software, through August 31, 2020 through Learn ArcGIS. Many colleges and universities also provide licenses to ArcGIS software. For non-students, a personal-use license for ArcGIS Pro costs $100 a year. ESRI also has programs for employees of Nonprofit Organizations and Conservation Organizations. If none of these options work, we can provide temporary 14-day ArcGIS Pro licenses to registered DroneCamp participants. Look for a welcome email with more info. b) Download the Software The current version of ArcGIS Pro is 2.5. You can download the setup file here. It is a big program - the installation file by itself is almost 1.8 GB. Give yourself enough time to download and install it. c) Install the software Installing the software is usually pretty straight forward, just double-click the setup file. The first time you run it, you’ll be prompted to update the software. That will take a few minutes as well. You’ll also be asked to log-in with a valid ArcGIS.com account to activate the software. ArcGIS Pro vs. ArcGIS Online ArcGIS Online is ESRI’s platform for creating web maps, accessing online data, publishing web data collection forms, etc. If you have a working license for ArcGIS Pro, it almost certainly includes access to ESRI’s online resources (which ArcGIS Pro requires). But the reverse is not always true. An online account may or may not activate ArcGIS Pro. Check the details of your license. ArcGIS Pro ‘Step Zero’ Assignment Please complete the ArcGIS Pro Step Zero assignment prior to DroneCamp. OpenDroneMap OpenDroneMap normally runs on a server, which could be on your local computer or could be somewhere on the cloud. Once you have a server going, you typically access OpenDroneMap through a browser (or Python). For DroneCamp, we’ll be using WebODM Lightning. WebODM Lightning has two parts. The Desktop App for Windows is a modest program you can install and provides a user-friendly interface to submit your images for processing, select processing options, view results, etc. However the destkop app by itself is useless - it doesn’t actually process any data! For that you need to connect it to a processing engine or ‘node’, which again could be running on your local computer or in the cloud. For the DroneCamp WebODM workshop, we would like everyone to: install the WebODM Lightning client for Windows, and sign-up for a free WebODM Lightning account This combo will give you a user-friendly interface and access to a good server on the cloud to stitch your images. The WebODM Lightning server is not free, but your WebODM Lightning account includes a generous 150 free credits which will be plenty for the DroneCamp exercise (don’t use them up before then!) To get started, please visit webodm.net. Look for the blue “Sign Up” button to create your WebODM Lightning account. Use the blue “Download For Windows 64bit” button to download and install the WebODM Lightning client. Once you’ve done both of these, you’ll be all set for DroneCamp. If you’d like to install OpenDroneMap your own hardware (and access it through a browser), you’re welcome to try that also. A Windows 10 or Ubuntu Linux computer with at least 16 GB RAM is recommended. (Manual installation instructions are here). This process has more steps and may require some fiddling. We won’t be able to address any installation or configuration issues during the presentation, so if it gives you trouble please use the Lightning method above. ODM ‘Step Zero’ Assignment Please complete the ODM Step Zero assignment prior to DroneCamp. Pix4Dmapper Pix4Dmapper is a professional drone photogrammetry software that creates spatially accurate 2D and 3D models from photos taken by a drone. To run it successfully, it requires a releatively recent computer with a multi-core CPU, 8GB of RAM (preferably more), and a CUDA compatible GPU. Pix4D Desktop runs on Windows only. Tip: Pix4Dmapper refers to a license that unlocks different features in Pix4D Desktop and Pix4D Cloud. Installing Pix4D Desktop requires about 500MB. Data for the workshop will be about 3.6GB. Unfortunately there is no cloud VM option for Pix4D. If you are unable to install the software on your own computer, you are welcome to join the workshop anyway and follow the instructor(s) as they go through the exercise. To install Pix4D Desktop, you need a valid Pix4D account. You can sign-up for Pix4D account and get a free 15-day trial license by going to https://cloud.pix4d.com. Caution: don’t start your 15-day Pix4D trial until June 11, 2020, or later, otherwise it’ll expire before DroneCamp! After you have your account, you can download the Pix4D Desktop from the link below. The latest release is 4.5.6. https://cloud.pix4d.com/download/ Installing Pix4D Desktop is fairly straight-forward. The first time you launch it you’ll be prompted to sign-in using your Pix4D account name and password. If you’d like to familiarize yourself with Pix4D before DroneCamp (recommended), select ‘Demo Project’ from the splash screen. There is also a Getting Started guide and a number of Example Projects with data you can download from Pix4D. Tip. You may be able to extend your trial license for an additional 10 days. For details see How to get a trial of Pix4D Desktop. Pix4D ‘Step Zero’ Assignment Please complete the Pix4Dmapper Step Zero assignment prior to DroneCamp.

We recommend using a Standalone installer. Installation is usually very straight-forward. For more detailed instructions, please visit: https://qgis.org/en/site/forusers/alldownloads.html QGIS is available on Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. Please note that the workshops in DroneCamp 2020 using QGIS were developed and tested on Windows. The software appearance or behavior may differ slightly on other operating systems. QGIS ‘Step Zero’ Assignment Please complete the QGIS Step Zero assignment prior to DroneCamp. Mission Planning Apps Mission Planning apps (also referred to as Flight Management, Autonomous Flight, or Ground Station apps) help you design and execute a flight to capture images for mapping. The DroneCamp Mission Planning workshop will include breakout sessions in which an instructor will demo how to plan a drone mission (flight) using one of the following common apps. If you’d like to follow along or complete the exercise on your own, you are encouraged to install one of the apps below. Note: With one exception (eMotion), the mission planning apps below are designed for mobile devices (Android and iOS). They work ok on phones, but are much easier to use on tablets. Professional drone mappers generally use tablets to design and execute drone missions due primarily to their larger screen size. Drone Deploy DroneDeploy is the mission planning app from DroneDeploy. It supports a wide range of drones and cameras, and is free to install and use. If you have a DroneDeploy subscription, you can also use it to upload images for processing. DroneDeploy is available for both Android and iOS. DJI Pilot DJI Pilot is a mission planning app for DJI’s higher-end drones, including the Matrice 200 series, Phantom 4 RTK, and Mavic 2 Enterprise drones. Available for both Android and iOS. eMotion eMotion is flight management software from Sensefly designed specifically for their eBee fixed wing drones. Unlike the other apps in the workshop, eMotion is Windows software and only available to people with a Sensefly account (i.e., who own an eBee). Therefore, installing it is not an option and the breakout session will be a demo of the features. Pix4Dcapture Pix4Dcapture is the mission planning app from Pix4D. It supports a wide range of drones and cameras, and is free to install and use. If you have a Pix4D subscription, you can also use it to upload images for processing. Available for Android and iOS. PrecisionFlight for DJI Drones PrecisionHawk’s PrecisionFlight mobile app is a full-featured flight planning app. It is free to install and use. If you have a PrecisionHawk subscription, you can also use it to upload images for processing. Available for Android only. "],
["participation.html", "Participating in DroneCamp Registration Getting the Zoom Links DroneCamp Email List Community Forum Being Safe &amp; Principles of Community", " Participating in DroneCamp Registration If you are interested in participating in DroneCamp but have not yet registered, registration info can found at http://ucanr.edu/dronecamp. Getting the Zoom Links DroneCamp will use several Zoom links. With a couple of exceptions, all sessions are limited to registered participants only. A Zoom account is not needed. Individualized Zoom connection links will be sent to you in a confirmation email(s). When you get a Zoom confirmation email, please save it! The connection link is unique to you, and you’ll need it to join the session(s). The confirmation email will also have links you can use to add the session to your Google Calendar, Yahoo, or Outlook. A small number of sessions may be open to all. These will be flagged accordingly in the Online Program. DroneCamp Email List All DroneCamp participants and instructors have been added to a moderated email list. The primary purpose of the DroneCamp email list is to share information and updates about DroneCamp. Participants are also welcome to use the list to share information, news, and questions related to drone mapping with fellow DroneCampers. The list is moderated and all messages must be approved by an administrator before they go out. The list will be shut down by the end of 2020 or whenever it becomes inactive. Community Forum In addition to the Zoom Chat window, everyone is invited to utilize the DroneCamp Community Forum to share information, notes, questions, links, tips and other resources related to drone mapping. The Community Forum is a Google Doc that anyone with the link can add comments to or make edits in Suggesting mode. After your first edit, an Administrator will make you an editor so you edit the document directly after that. Being Safe &amp; Principles of Community Virtual courses like DroneCamp remove many of the geographic barriers for participation, but they also involve new ways of interaction. Just like in-person events, we ask all participants to practice the following general guidelines for community. Mutual Respect Everyone is welcome regardless of their background or skill level. Please treat each other and all instructors with mutual respect. People learn with different styles and at different paces; instrucors will do their best to accommodate everyone. Sharing Personal Information Be cautious about sharing any personal information in chat sessions, Q&amp;A sessions, and the Community Forum. Anything you share online could in theory be saved and shared with others. Reporting Inappropriate Content and Behavior If you’re concerned about chat messages or any other kind of inappropriate behavior, first send a private chat message to the session facilitator (host). You may also share concerns by sending a message to dronecamp@ucanr.edu. "],
["mission-planning-exercise.html", "Mission Planning Exercise Scenario Study Area Assignment Write-Up", " Mission Planning Exercise In this exercise, your job is to design flights to map 400 acres of a nature reserve using a Phantom 4 Pro for a long-term environmental monitoring program. Challenges to overcome include : You have to think about what GSD (resolution) is needed to meet the project goals The area is too big to complete in one flight The area is hilly and forested, which will constrain your options for launch points Since you’ve never been there, you need to refer to local maps as well as your mission planning app Scenario The head research biologist at Hastings Natural History Reservation [map] in Monterey County, California has asked you to collect imagery with a drone for a long-term vegetation monitoring program. The monitoring program has both management and research goals, including: detecting tree mortality modeling habitat connectivity developing hydrological models modeling wildfire dynamics &amp; planning fire control strategies tracking feral pig damage monitoring illegal activities (e.g., unauthorized camping, pot growing, dumping) Study Area The monitoring area is ~400 acres in the central part of Hastings Reserve, to the east of Big Creek and north of Robertson Creek (see red outline below, also links to web maps). The area is hilly and there are two peaks in the monitoring zone. The vegetation is dominated by oak woodland with open grassy areas (and a lot of poison oak). There are roads along the southern and western boundaries, and an access road to the Robertson House on the eastern side. KMLs: study area (ver 2 for DJI Pilot) • hastings boundary Maps: Google map • CalTopo map • Hastings topo map Assignment Explore the study area using the web map links above. Download the KML of the study area (ver 2 for DJI Pilot) and load it into your flight planning app. Select your drone in the app settings (e.g., Phantom 4 Pro). How many flights do you need to cover this area? Where will you launch from? Use the app to design the flights. Save the project so you’ll be ready when you get to the site. Tip: remember that the estimated flight time in flight apps generally does not include the time to get to the first way point. Write-Up If taking this for credit, complete the exercise worksheet. "]
