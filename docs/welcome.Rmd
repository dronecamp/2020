# Welcome Email #1

*June 1, 2020*

Hi all,

Thank you for signing up for DroneCamp! We're super excited to meet everyone and start the course – in just 3 weeks!

This is the first of 3 welcome emails with information about the upcoming program. Please take a quick look as there is an action item and some important info on preparation.

<span class="lead">DroneCamp Program</span>. We're pleased to share the online DroneCamp Program (https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/). Although still under development, the Program has session descriptions, instructor profiles, and software installation instructions. As we get closer, links for slides, exercises, and other workshop materials will be added.

<span class="lead">DroneCamp email list</span>. You've been added to the DroneCamp2020 email list (which is how you're receiving this email). This email list is moderated and primarily intended to share info and updates about the program. If you’d like to switch your registered email address, send an email to dronecamp@ucanr.edu.

<span class="lead">Background Survey</span>. Please complete a short [Background Survey](https://forms.gle/Ar4HBZdWUWcYhC697){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to help the instructors learn about your background, interests, and software needs. Please complete the survey by June 15. As an added incentive, people who complete the survey by June 15 and provide a mailing address will be mailed a limited edition DroneCamp sticker.

A second survey will be coming next week to select which of the concurrent workshop you'd like to attend, so be on the lookout for that.

<span class="lead">Speed talks</span>. One of the goals of DroneCamp is to help drone mappers connect with each other. Accordingly we're having a session of 5-minute speed talks on Thursday, June 25. Talks can cover any aspect of drone mapping including projects, program summaries, calls for collaboration, hardware development, research plans, etc. Submit your idea for a speed talk on the [Background Survey](https://forms.gle/Ar4HBZdWUWcYhC697){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. A limited number of spots are available and talks will be accepted on a rolling basis until all spaces are full.

<span class="lead">Software</span>. Several workshops will cover photogrammetry and GIS software that you can use to stitch drone images together and analyze the results. To complete the hands-on component of these workshops (optional), you'll need to install software on your own computer.

Four photogrammetry (stitching) programs will be covered. **Pix4Dmapper** & **ArcGIS Pro** will be covered on Tuesday (at the same time, so you have to pick one). **Agisoft Metashape** and **OpenDroneMap** will be covered on Wednesday (again, pick one). In other words, you don't need to install all four photogrammetry applications. Similarly, workshops to analyze drone results with GIS software using **ArcGIS Pro** and **QGIS** to will be covered at the same time on Wednesday afternoon (pick one).

Installation instructions for all software are on the Computer Setup page on the Online Program. **Pix4Dmapper** and **Metashape** both offer trial licenses (but don't start the trials too soon!). ESRI's trial license program for ArcGIS Pro is currently on hold due to COVID-19. However, there are license programs for education and nonprofits. If none of these options work, we can provide a temporary ArcGIS Pro license (complete the appropriate section of the Background Survey).

All of the software used at DroneCamp is well-developed and generally installs pretty smoothly. However if you’re having problems, we’ve scheduled drop-in Tech Support sessions for Friday, June 19. See the Program for details.

<span class="lead">More Ways to Prepare: GeoEd'20 Conference, June 9-10</span>. By happy coincidence, the [GeoEd'20 Conference](https://geoed20-kctcs.hub.arcgis.com/) is being held next week Tuesday and Wednesday (June 9-10). All the sessions look interesting, but two in particular (unfortunately at the same time) may be of interest to DroneCampers:

- Working with Imagery in ArcGIS Pro. Tues June 9, 9:00am - 11:00am PDT.
    
- Using the Drone Racing League (Online) Simulator. Tues June 9, 9:00am - 11:00am PDT.

<span class="lead">What's Coming Next</span>. Next week, we'll send you a survey whereby you can indicate which of the hands-on workshops you want to join. Zoom links for these sessions will follow after that.

The week before DroneCamp, we'll send another email with instructions to download the data.

<span class="lead">Questions?</span>

Check out the [FAQs](http://igis.ucanr.edu/dronecamp/faq/), and if you don’t see it there please contact us at dronecamp@ucanr.edu.

Thanks!

# Email #2: Sign-up for Concurrent Sessions (Required); Software Setup

*June 14, 2020*

Hi all,

DroneCamp starts in just over a week! Please read through this 2nd welcome email as there are a couple of important action items. If you didn’t catch the first welcome email, you can find a copy [here](https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/welcome.html).

## Background Survey

If you didn’t complete the short Background Survey, you may still do so [here](https://forms.gle/Ar4HBZdWUWcYhC697). As a reminder, you need to complete the Background Survey if you plan to take any of the ArcGIS Pro workshops and need a temporary license. The deadline is **Tuesday June 16**.

## Important Action Item: Sign-Up for Concurrent Sessions

There are five concurrent sessions you need to sign-up for (including all the hands-on software workshops). Please complete [this form](https://forms.gle/frSkdNV9SCyoViRK9) to sign-up for your preferred sessions.

To help you decide which sessions to sign-up for, please review the session descriptions on the [Program](https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/), as well as the discussion of [GIS and Photogrammetry Software](https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/setup.html#gis-and-photogrammetry-software). If you have any questions please let us know.

Signing-up for a concurrent session does not lock you in. You can change your mind up until the day before the workshop by simply completing the form again. But remember you must sign-up for the concurrent sessions using <https://forms.gle/frSkdNV9SCyoViRK9>this form in order to get the link to join the Zoom session.

## New: “Step Zero” Assignments for GIS and Photogrammetry Workshops

To avoid snafus with software installation and downloading data during the hands-on photogrammetry and GIS workshops, we’d like everyone who plans to do the exercises in the software workshops to complete a “Step Zero” (Setup) assignment for each piece of software.

These short assignments require you to install the software, download some data, and bring the data into the program. Step Zero assignments can be found in the [GIS and Photogrammetry Software](https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/setup.html#gis-and-photogrammetry-software) section of the Program.

Additional links for downloading workshop data will be posted next week (be ready - some of the datasets are somewhat large).

## Drop-in Tech Support Sessions June 18 & 19

We are holding four drop-in Tech Support sessions next Thursday and Friday (June 18 & 19) for anyone who would like some help installing software, or just wants to test your Zoom connection. The Zoom link will be posted on the Program the day before. Sign-up is not necessary.

## Questions?

Please contact us at dronecamp@ucanr.edu, or come to one of the drop-in Tech Support Zoom sessions.

Thanks!

DroneCamp Planning Team
