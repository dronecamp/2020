# Welcome Email #1

*June 1, 2020*

Hi all,

Thank you for signing up for DroneCamp! We're super excited to meet everyone and start the course – in just 3 weeks!

This is the first of 3 welcome emails with information about the upcoming program. Please take a quick look as there is an action item and some important info on preparation.

**DroneCamp Program**. We're pleased to share the online DroneCamp Program (https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/). Although still under development, the Program has session descriptions, instructor profiles, and software installation instructions. As we get closer, links for slides, exercises, and other workshop materials will be added.

DroneCamp email list. You've been added to the DroneCamp2020 email list (which is how you're receiving this email). This email list is moderated and primarily intended to share info and updates about the program. If you’d like to switch your registered email address, send an email to dronecamp@ucanr.edu.

Background Survey. Please complete a short [Background Survey](https://forms.gle/Ar4HBZdWUWcYhC697){target="_blank" rel="noopener"} to help the instructors learn about your background, interests, and software needs. Please complete the survey by June 15. As an added incentive, people who complete the survey by June 15 and provide a mailing address will be mailed a limited edition DroneCamp sticker.

A second survey will be coming next week to select which of the concurrent workshop you'd like to attend, so be on the lookout for that.

**Speed talks**. One of the goals of DroneCamp is to help drone mappers connect with each other. Accordingly we're having a session of 5-minute speed talks on Thursday, June 25. Talks can cover any aspect of drone mapping including projects, program summaries, calls for collaboration, hardware development, research plans, etc. Submit your idea for a speed talk on the [Background Survey](https://forms.gle/Ar4HBZdWUWcYhC697){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. A limited number of spots are available and talks will be accepted on a rolling basis until all spaces are full.

**Software**. Several workshops will cover photogrammetry and GIS software that you can use to stitch drone images together and analyze the results. To complete the hands-on component of these workshops (optional), you'll need to install software on your own computer.

Four photogrammetry (stitching) programs will be covered. **Pix4Dmapper** & **ArcGIS Pro** will be covered on Tuesday (at the same time, so you have to pick one). **Agisoft Metashape** and **OpenDroneMap** will be covered on Wednesday (again, pick one). In other words, you don't need to install all four photogrammetry applications. Similarly, workshops to analyze drone results with GIS software using **ArcGIS Pro** and **QGIS** to will be covered at the same time on Wednesday afternoon (pick one).

Installation instructions for all software are on the Computer Setup page on the Online Program. **Pix4Dmapper** and **Metashape** both offer trial licenses (but don't start the trials too soon!). ESRI's trial license program for ArcGIS Pro is currently on hold due to COVID-19. However, there are license programs for education and nonprofits. If none of these options work, we can provide a temporary ArcGIS Pro license (complete the appropriate section of the Background Survey).

All of the software used at DroneCamp is well-developed and generally installs pretty smoothly. However if you’re having problems, we’ve scheduled drop-in Tech Support sessions for Friday, June 19. See the Program for details.

**More Ways to Prepare: GeoEd'20 Conference, June 9-10**

By happy coincidence, the GeoEd'20 Conference is being held next week Tuesday and Wednesday (June 9-10). All the sessions look interesting, but two in particular (unfortunately at the same time) may be of interest to DroneCampers:

- Working with Imagery in ArcGIS Pro. Tues June 9, 9:00am - 11:00am PDT.
    
- Using the Drone Racing League (Online) Simulator. Tues June 9, 9:00am - 11:00am PDT.

**What's Coming Next**

Next week, we'll send you a survey whereby you can indicate which of the hands-on workshops you want to join. Zoom links for these sessions will follow after that.

The week before DroneCamp, we'll send another email with instructions to download the data.

**Questions?**

Check out the FAQs, and if you don’t see it there please contact us at dronecamp@ucanr.edu.

Thanks!

DroneCamp Planning Team
