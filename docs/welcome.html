<p>Welcome to DroneCamp! If you missed any of the welcome emails, you can catch up below.</p>

<div id="welcome-email-1" class="section level1">
<h1>Welcome Email #1</h1>
<p><em>June 1, 2020</em></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>Thank you for signing up for DroneCamp! We’re super excited to meet everyone and start the course – in just 3 weeks!</p>
<p>This is the first of 3 welcome emails with information about the upcoming program. Please take a quick look as there is an action item and some important info on preparation.</p>
<p><span class="lead">DroneCamp Program</span>. We’re pleased to share the online DroneCamp Program (<a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/" class="uri">https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/</a>). Although still under development, the Program has session descriptions, instructor profiles, and software installation instructions. As we get closer, links for slides, exercises, and other workshop materials will be added.</p>
<p><span class="lead">DroneCamp email list</span>. You’ve been added to the DroneCamp2020 email list (which is how you’re receiving this email). This email list is moderated and primarily intended to share info and updates about the program. If you’d like to switch your registered email address, send an email to <a href="mailto:dronecamp@ucanr.edu" class="email">dronecamp@ucanr.edu</a>.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Background Survey</span>. Please complete a short <a href="https://forms.gle/Ar4HBZdWUWcYhC697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Background Survey</a> to help the instructors learn about your background, interests, and software needs. Please complete the survey by June 15. As an added incentive, people who complete the survey by June 15 and provide a mailing address will be mailed a limited edition DroneCamp sticker.</p>
<p>A second survey will be coming next week to select which of the concurrent workshop you’d like to attend, so be on the lookout for that.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Speed talks</span>. One of the goals of DroneCamp is to help drone mappers connect with each other. Accordingly we’re having a session of 5-minute speed talks on Thursday, June 25. Talks can cover any aspect of drone mapping including projects, program summaries, calls for collaboration, hardware development, research plans, etc. Submit your idea for a speed talk on the <a href="https://forms.gle/Ar4HBZdWUWcYhC697" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Background Survey</a>. A limited number of spots are available and talks will be accepted on a rolling basis until all spaces are full.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Software</span>. Several workshops will cover photogrammetry and GIS software that you can use to stitch drone images together and analyze the results. To complete the hands-on component of these workshops (optional), you’ll need to install software on your own computer.</p>
<p>Four photogrammetry (stitching) programs will be covered. <strong>Pix4Dmapper</strong> &amp; <strong>ArcGIS Pro</strong> will be covered on Tuesday (at the same time, so you have to pick one). <strong>Agisoft Metashape</strong> and <strong>OpenDroneMap</strong> will be covered on Wednesday (again, pick one). In other words, you don’t need to install all four photogrammetry applications. Similarly, workshops to analyze drone results with GIS software using <strong>ArcGIS Pro</strong> and <strong>QGIS</strong> to will be covered at the same time on Wednesday afternoon (pick one).</p>
<p>Installation instructions for all software are on the Computer Setup page on the Online Program. <strong>Pix4Dmapper</strong> and <strong>Metashape</strong> both offer trial licenses (but don’t start the trials too soon!). ESRI’s trial license program for ArcGIS Pro is currently on hold due to COVID-19. However, there are license programs for education and nonprofits. If none of these options work, we can provide a temporary ArcGIS Pro license (complete the appropriate section of the Background Survey).</p>
<p>All of the software used at DroneCamp is well-developed and generally installs pretty smoothly. However if you’re having problems, we’ve scheduled drop-in Tech Support sessions for Friday, June 19. See the Program for details.</p>
<p><span class="lead">More Ways to Prepare: GeoEd’20 Conference, June 9-10</span>. By happy coincidence, the <a href="https://geoed20-kctcs.hub.arcgis.com/">GeoEd’20 Conference</a> is being held next week Tuesday and Wednesday (June 9-10). All the sessions look interesting, but two in particular (unfortunately at the same time) may be of interest to DroneCampers:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Working with Imagery in ArcGIS Pro. Tues June 9, 9:00am - 11:00am PDT.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the Drone Racing League (Online) Simulator. Tues June 9, 9:00am - 11:00am PDT.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><span class="lead">What’s Coming Next</span>. Next week, we’ll send you a survey whereby you can indicate which of the hands-on workshops you want to join. Zoom links for these sessions will follow after that.</p>
<p>The week before DroneCamp, we’ll send another email with instructions to download the data.</p>
<p><span class="lead">Questions?</span></p>
<p>Check out the <a href="http://igis.ucanr.edu/dronecamp/faq/">FAQs</a>, and if you don’t see it there please contact us at <a href="mailto:dronecamp@ucanr.edu" class="email">dronecamp@ucanr.edu</a>.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h1>Email #2: Sign-up for Concurrent Sessions (Required); Software Setup</h1>
<p><em>June 14, 2020</em></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>DroneCamp starts in just over a week! Please read through this 2nd welcome email as there are a couple of important action items. If you didn’t catch the first welcome email, you can find a copy <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/welcome.html">here</a>.</p>
<div id="background-survey" class="section level2">
<h2>Background Survey</h2>
<p>If you didn’t complete the short Background Survey, you may still do so <a href="https://forms.gle/Ar4HBZdWUWcYhC697">here</a>. As a reminder, you need to complete the Background Survey if you plan to take any of the ArcGIS Pro workshops and need a temporary license. The deadline is <strong>Tuesday June 16</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div id="important-action-item-sign-up-for-concurrent-sessions" class="section level2">
<h2>Important Action Item: Sign-Up for Concurrent Sessions</h2>
<p>There are five concurrent sessions you need to sign-up for (including all the hands-on software workshops). Please complete <a href="https://forms.gle/frSkdNV9SCyoViRK9">this form</a> to sign-up for your preferred sessions.</p>
<p>To help you decide which sessions to sign-up for, please review the session descriptions on the <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/">Program</a>, as well as the discussion of <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/setup.html#gis-and-photogrammetry-software">GIS and Photogrammetry Software</a>. If you have any questions please let us know.</p>
<p>Signing-up for a concurrent session does not lock you in. You can change your mind up until the day before the workshop by simply completing the form again. But remember you must sign-up for the concurrent sessions using <a href="https://forms.gle/frSkdNV9SCyoViRK9" class="uri">https://forms.gle/frSkdNV9SCyoViRK9</a>this form in order to get the link to join the Zoom session.</p>
</div>
<div id="new-step-zero-assignments-for-gis-and-photogrammetry-workshops" class="section level2">
<h2>New: “Step Zero” Assignments for GIS and Photogrammetry Workshops</h2>
<p>To avoid snafus with software installation and downloading data during the hands-on photogrammetry and GIS workshops, we’d like everyone who plans to do the exercises in the software workshops to complete a “Step Zero” (Setup) assignment for each piece of software.</p>
<p>These short assignments require you to install the software, download some data, and bring the data into the program. Step Zero assignments can be found in the <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/setup.html#gis-and-photogrammetry-software">GIS and Photogrammetry Software</a> section of the Program.</p>
<p>Additional links for downloading workshop data will be posted next week (be ready - some of the datasets are somewhat large).</p>
</div>
<div id="drop-in-tech-support-sessions-june-18-19" class="section level2">
<h2>Drop-in Tech Support Sessions June 18 &amp; 19</h2>
<p>We are holding four drop-in Tech Support sessions next Thursday and Friday (June 18 &amp; 19) for anyone who would like some help installing software, or just wants to test your Zoom connection. The Zoom link will be posted on the Program the day before. Sign-up is not necessary.</p>
</div>
<div id="questions" class="section level2">
<h2>Questions?</h2>
<p>Please contact us at <a href="mailto:dronecamp@ucanr.edu" class="email">dronecamp@ucanr.edu</a>, or come to one of the drop-in Tech Support Zoom sessions.</p>
<p>Thanks!</p>

<h1>Email #3: Preparing for DroneCamp Part 3</h1>
<p><em>June 18, 2020</em></p>
<p>Hi all,</p>
<p>We look forward to ‘meeting’ everyone next week for DroneCamp! This is the 3rd getting ready email (if you missed either of the first two, you can see them <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/welcome.html">here</a>).</p>
<div id="reminder-1-select-your-concurrent-sessions-required" class="section level2">
<h2>Reminder #1: Select Your Concurrent Sessions (Required)</h2>
<p>If you haven’t already done so, your #1 preparation task for next week is to complete the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfqp1t05t02l6IvjubrEaZEniJp40zULmSNnMTRzhySK8A7Jw/viewform">Concurrent Sessions Sign-Up</a> form. This is the <em>only</em> way you’ll get links to join those five sessions (which includes all the hands-on software workshops). Please make sure you enter the same email address you used to register. <em>You won’t be able to join at the last minute!</em></p>
</div>
<div id="reminder-2.-install-software" class="section level2">
<h2>Reminder #2. Install Software</h2>
<p>The second most important thing is to install any required software for the hands-on sessions you selected (i.e., not everything!). Details on the software needed for each workshop are in the <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/">session descriptions</a>, with links to instructions and download links.</p>
<p>Most of the software programs also have a “<strong>Step Zero</strong>” assignment, which we’d like you to complete before DroneCamp. These short assignments require you to install a program, download some data, load the data, and view it. They don’t take long, but are important because there won’t be time to trouble-shoot basic setup steps during DroneCamp. If you encounter problems, come to the <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/2020-06-19.html">Drop-in Tech Support</a> hours on Friday June 19.</p>
</div>
<div id="top-five-tips-for-a-successful-dronecamp-experience" class="section level2">
<h2>Top-Five Tips for a Successful DroneCamp Experience</h2>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Prioritize what’s most important</strong>. DroneCamp covers a broad range of skills and knowledge needed to use drones for mapping. But that doesn’t mean every session will be equally important to you. Think about your goals for the next six months, whether that’s flight planning, becoming a safer pilot, learning how to ‘stitch’ drone photos to create spatially corrected GIS layers, or analysis.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Plan your schedule</strong>. Five hours of Zoom per day is exhausting! If you have the time and energy great, but if not think about the sessions you’re most interested in. After that, what sessions might you join but pay less-attention to, or skip and catch the recording later? (see below for more info on recordings)</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Get your workspace ready</strong>. You’ll be able to focus better if you’re joining from somewhere that’s comfortable without too much background noise. Many people find headphones a good way to reduce distractions. If your internet is so-so, consider joining the audio via phone. For software workshops, a second screen is strongly recommended so you can watch the instructor’s demo on one screen as you complete the exercise on the other. A mouse is also strongly recommended for the GIS and photogrammetry hands-on workshops, which involve a lot of clicking and scrolling.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don’t be shy about asking questions</strong>. Drone mapping is pretty new, and nobody picks it up all at once. The instructors are all experts in their fields, but that also means they may sometime use terms or language that isn’t familiar to normal people. Don’t be shy about asking questions during sessions, either in the Q&amp;A window or the chat window. If there isn’t time to address every question (and there probably won’t be), questions will be addressed in the Community Forum.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Take advantage of the Community Forum</strong>. The Community Forum is simply a Google Doc that will be available to everyone during DroneCamp. Use it to share resources, respond to questions, etc.</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="next-assignment-download-workshop-data" class="section level2">
<h2>Next Assignment: Download Workshop Data</h2>
<p>The hands-on workshops start on Tuesday! Between now and then, you should check the <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/">session description(s)</a> for the hands-on workshops you signed-up for, and download the data at least one day before the workshop. Data downloads range from ~75MB up to 3.6 GB (Pix4D). Give yourself enough time to download.</p>
</div>
<div id="open-sessions-on-thursday-june-25" class="section level2">
<h2>Open Sessions on Thursday June 25!</h2>
<p>In the spirit of building community, the Thursday sessions from noon onward will be open to everyone with the link (i.e., DroneCamp registration not required). These include the lunchtime <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/2020-06-25.html#special-session-on-dart">DART Symposium Preview</a>, the <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/2020-06-25.html#data-analysis-methods-for-ag-research">Data Analysis Methods for Ag Research</a>, <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/2020-06-25.html#uas-applications-in-coastal-and-marine-systems">UAS Applications in Coastal and Marine Systems</a>, and <a href="https://dronecamp.github.io/2020/2020-06-25.html#workforce-development-and-higher-ed">Workforce Development and Higher Ed</a> tracks. Zoom links will be posted on the Program. Please share with colleagues, but not the entire universe (or we could hit the ceiling of maximum participants).</p>
</div>
<div id="where-are-my-zoom-links" class="section level2">
<h2>Where are my Zoom Links?</h2>
<p>With the exception of open sessions, all Zoom links will be emailed to you individually. Zoom links are individualized and can only be used on one device (you may of course join the audio from a phone). Don’t share your connection links or you may get locked out yourself!</p>
<p>Zoom links will be emailed by noon (PDT) on Friday June 19. Expect 5-10 emails depending on how many concurrent sessions you signed up for. If you haven’t got your links by noon on Friday, please contact <a href="mailto:ANRProgramSupport@ucanr.edu">ANR Program Support</a>.</p>
<p>Emails will come from <strong><a href="mailto:no-reply@zoom.us" class="email">no-reply@zoom.us</a></strong>, which some email program flag as spam ☹. So before you email for support, <em>check your spam folder</em>. Adding <a href="mailto:no-reply@zoom.us" class="email">no-reply@zoom.us</a> to your contact list may also prevent them from getting flagged as spam.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t lose your Zoom links!</strong> We are using both Zoom webinar and Zoom meeting links, and will try to resend the links each morning during DroneCamp week. The name of the meeting will tell you which day &amp; session it is for, which you can also cross-check on the Program. If you are new to Zoom, this <a href="https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/201362193-Joining-a-meeting">short tutorial</a> illustrates how to join a Zoom webinar / meeting.</p>
<p>If you have problems or are confused by Zoom, please email <a href="mailto:ANRProgramSupport@ucanr.edu" class="email">ANRProgramSupport@ucanr.edu</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="session-recordings" class="section level2">
<h2>Session Recordings</h2>
<p>All sessions, including hands-on workshops, will be recorded. We will share links to Zoom recordings the same day via the DroneCamp email list (pending consent of the presenters, and how quickly we get them from Zoom). You’ll be able to view recordings online via Zoom for several weeks, including a download option for at least the first week. More details will be provided during DroneCamp.</p>
