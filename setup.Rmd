# Computer Setup

## Setting Up Your Workspace 

Try to find a spot which is **comfortable** and **relatively free from distractions** and background noise. A little background noise is not a problem as you can mute yourself, but consider a pair of headphones to minimize distractions. 

**Ergonomics** are important! If you've ever tried to work on a laptop while sitting on a couch for 4 hours, it isn't ideal. We will of course take breaks.

A **second screen** is very helpful, especially for hands-on workshops where you'll be working through a software tutorial. With a second screen, you can view the instructor / slides in one window, and work on RStudio in the other. 

If you have an **external monitor** for your laptop / computer, you're all set. You can put Zoom on one monitor and RStudio on the other. If you don't have a second monitor, a **tablet** can be used to watch the slides / presentation as you work through the exercise on your laptop. Zoom is  available as an app for all major tablets and phones. 

## Zoom{id='zoom'}

This workshop will be taught entirely online using the Zoom platform (the link will be sent you via email, we'll use the same link for all sessions). 

Please install the **Zoom client** on your laptop, which you can [download here](https://zoom.us/download){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}. If you've used Zoom before, and you see Zoom in the Start Menu (Windows) or Finder (Mac), then you already have the client. Please make sure you have the **latest version**, as some of the buttons and features have changed.

A **Zoom account** is *not* required. A **webcam** is not required. 

### Viewing RStudio and Zoom Simultaneously

*Single Screen Options*

If a second screen isn't possible, you can also arrange your windows so that you see both RStudio and Zoom (see below for example). You can devote the entire width of the Zoom window to the screen share by going to 'View Options' and making sure side-by-side mode is turned **off**.

Zoom unfortunately does not have an 'always on top' mode, but you can keep the Zoom client on top by using a 3rd party utility like [DeskPins](https://efotinis.neocities.org/deskpins/index.html){target="_blank" rel="noopener"}.

### Sharing Your Screen

You are encouraged to **Share your R application window** (i.e. RStudio or a browser window if you're using RStudio Cloud) during the exercises, so the instructor can see how you're doing and/or answer questions. Click the 'Share Screen' button on Zoom, and select your R window. (Note: please don't share the entire screen to avoid accidentally sharing other windows!)

### Audio

If you find the audio is garbled, you can **dial-in** with a phone. In that case, you should disconnect from the the audio on your laptop or tablet (to prevent echo).

**Muting** and **unmuting** yourself are essential skills for Zoom. It's generally good practice to stay muted until you have something to say.

If you're using the Zoom app on Windows, click the microphone button. If you're using the Zoom app for phones and tablets, tap the middle of the screen to make the controls visible.

If you dial-in on a phone, you can use the 'mute' button on your phone app, or dial `*6` to mute or unmute yourself.
